The original article by Calvin Luo is highly recommended! It helps a lot!\nEvidence Lower Bound What are likelihood-based generative models? What are autoregressive generative models? The transformer family belongs to autoregressive models.\nFor likelihood-based generative models, we want to model the true data distribution by maximizing the likelihood $p(x)$ of all observed data $x$. We can think of the data we observed as represented or generated by an associated unseen latent variable, which can be denoted by random variable $z$. There are two direct but difficult ways to compute the likelihood $p(x)$:\n$p(x) = \\int p(x,z)dz$: intractable for complex models since it involves integrating all latent variables.\n$p(x) = \\frac{p(x,z)}{p(z|x)}$: difficult since it involves having access to a ground truth $p(z|x)$.\nHere I have a question: How do you know the true joint distribution $p(x,z)$?\nHowever, we can derive a term called the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) using the above two equations. So what is the ELBO? As its name suggests, it is a lower bound of the evidence. But what is the evidence? The evidence is the log likelihood of the observed data. The relationship between the evidence and the ELBO can be mathematically written as:\n$$ \\begin{align} \\log p(x) \u0026amp;= \\mathbb{E}{q\\phi(z|x)}[\\log \\frac{p(x,z)}{q_\\phi(z|x)}] + D_{KL}(q_\\phi(z|x)||p(z|x)) \\ \u0026amp; \\geq \\underbrace{\\mathbb{E}{q\\phi(z|x)}[\\log \\frac{p(x,z)}{q_\\phi(z|x)}]}_\\text{ELBO} \\end{align} $$\nWhy the ELBO is an objective we would like to maximize?\nThe ELBO is indeed a lower bound of the evidence.\nAny maximization of the ELBO term with respect $\\phi$ necessarily invokes an equal minimization of the $D_{KL}(q_\\phi(z|x)||p(z|x))$. Because the sum of the ELBO and the DL term is a constant with respect to $\\phi$ (the evidence $\\log p(x)$ does not depend on $\\phi$).\nAs we will see below, the ELBO can be further dissect into several interpretable components which can be computed analytically or approximated using existing estimate methods.\nVariational Autoencoders In the vanilla VAE, we directly maximize the ELBO. The ELBO can be further divided into two parts:\n$$ \\begin{equation} \\mathbb{E}{q\\phi(z|x)}[\\log \\frac{p(x,z)}{q_\\phi(z|x)}] = \\mathbb{E}{q\\phi(z|x)}[\\log p_\\theta(x|z)] - D_{KL}(q_\\phi(z|x) || p(z)) \\end{equation} $$\nHere $q_\\phi(z|x)$ can be regarded as the encoder with parameters $\\phi$ and $p_\\theta(x|z)$ can be regarded as the decoder with parameters $\\theta$. So there are two kinds of parameters to be optimized:\nEncoder parameters: $\\phi$ Decoder parameters: $\\theta$ The meaning of the name of VAE is:\nVariational: optimize for the best $q_\\phi(z|x)$ among a family of potential posterior distributions parameterized by $\\phi$. AutoEncoder: reminiscent of a traditional autoencoder model. How dose VAE optimize the ELBO jointly with parameters $\\phi$ and $\\theta$? To my understanding, VAE uses three techniques to do this:\nGaussian assumption.\nMonte Carlo estimate.\nReparameterization trick.\nThe encoder $q_\\phi(z|x)$ and the prior $p(z)$ are commonly chosen to be Gaussian, which makes the KL divergence term of the ELBO having closed-form expression, i.e.\n$$ \\begin{align} q_\\phi(z|x) \u0026amp;= \\mathcal{N}(z; \\mu_\\phi(x), \\sigma_\\phi^2(x)I) \\ p(z) \u0026amp;= \\mathcal{N}(z; 0, I) \\ D_{KL}(q_\\phi(z|x) || p(z)) \u0026amp; \\text{ can be computed analytically}. \\end{align} $$\nThe first term of the ELBO can be approximated using a Monte Carlo estimate, i.e.\n$$ \\mathbb{E}{q\\phi(z|x)}[\\log p_\\theta(x|z)] \\approx \\sum_{l=1}^{L}\\log p_{\\theta}(x|z^{(l)}) $$\nwhere ${z^{(l)}}{l=1}^{L}$ are sampled from $q\\phi(z|x)$ for every observation $x$ in the dataset, and $L$ is often set to be $1$ in practice.\nThe reparameterization trick writers a random variable as a deterministic function of a noise variable, and this allows for the optimization of the non-stochatic terms through gradient descent, i.e.\n$$ z = \\bm{\\mu}{\\bm{\\phi}}(x) + \\bm{\\sigma}{\\bm{\\phi}}(x)\\odot\\bm{\\epsilon} \\quad \\text{with } \\bm{\\epsilon} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\bm{\\epsilon};\\bm{0}, \\textbf{I}) $$\nThe objective function of VAE is ELBO which contains the reconstruction term $\\log [p_\\theta(x|z)]$, and which kind of loss is commonly used in practice for the reconstruction term? MSE?\nThe real reason you use MSE and cross-entropy loss functions Modern Latent Variable Models and Variational Inference Why don\u0026rsquo;t we use MSE as a reconstruction loss for VAE ? A Hierarchical VAE is a generalization of a VAE that extends to multiple hierarchies over latent variables. A special case of HVAE is Markovian HVAE where the generative process is a Markov chain.\nVariational Diffusion Models A variational diffusion model can be regarded as a special case of a Markovian HVAE with three restrictions:\nThe latent dimension is exactly equal to the data dimension.\nThe encoder is pre-defined as a linear Gaussian.\nThe Gaussian parameters of the latent encoders vary over time in such a way that the distribution of the latent at final timestep $T$ is a standard Gaussian.\nThe variational diffusion model can be optimized by maximizing the ELBO, which can be derived as:\n$$ \\begin{align} \\log p(x) \u0026amp; \\geq \\mathbb{E}{q(x{1:T}|x_0)}[\\log \\frac{p(x_{0:T})}{q(x_{1:T}|x_0)}] \\ \u0026amp; = \\mathbb{E}{q(x_1|x_0)}[\\log p\\theta(x_0|x_1)] - \\mathbb{E}{q(x{T-1}|x_0)}[D_{KL}(q(x_T|x_{T-1}) || p(x_T))] - \\sum_{t=1}^{T-1}\\mathbb{E}{q(x{t-1},x_{t+1}|x_0)}[D_{KL}(q(x_t|x_{t-1}) || p_\\theta(x_t|x_{t+1}))] \\end{align} $$\nCurrently, I don\u0026rsquo;t know how to derive the third term of the above equation, i.e.\n$$ q(x_{t-1}, x_t, x_{t+1}|x_0) \\overset{\\text{?}}{=} q(x_{t-1},x_{t+1}|x_0) q(x_t|x_{t-1}) $$\nAs pointed out by Calvin Luo, optimizing the ELBO using the terms above is suboptimal; because the third term is computed as an expectation over two random variables for every timestep, and the variance of its Monte Carlo estimate could potentially be higher than that only having one variable.\nUsing Markov property and Bayes rule, we have\n$$ \\begin{align} q(x_t|x_{t-1}) \u0026amp;= q(x_t|x_{t-1}, x_0) \\ \u0026amp;= \\frac{q(x_{t-1}|x_t,x_0) q(x_t|x_0)}{q(x_{t-1}|x_0)} \\end{align} $$\nArmed with above equation, the ELBO can be derived as:\n$$ \\begin{align} \\log p(x) \u0026amp; \\geq \\mathbb{E}{q(x{1:T}|x_0)}[\\log \\frac{p(x_{0:T})}{q(x_{1:T}|x_0)}] \\ \u0026amp; = \\underbrace{\\mathbb{E}{q(x_1|x_0)}[\\log p\\theta(x_0|x_1)]}{\\text{reconstruction term}} - \\underbrace{D{KL}(q(x_T|x_0) || p(x_T))}{\\text{prior matching term}} - \\sum{t=2}^{T}\\underbrace{\\mathbb{E}{q(x_t|x_0)}[D{KL}(q(x_{t-1}|x_t,x_0) || p_\\theta(x_{t-1}|x_t))]}_{\\text{denoising matching term}} \\end{align} $$\nNow, to optimize the ELBO, the main difficulty comes from the denoising matching term. However, with Gaussian assumption in the variational diffusion model, a nice property is that $q(x_{t-1}|x_t, x_0)$ has a closed form: Gaussian! Let\u0026rsquo;s explain how this nice property emerges.\nStep 1. Rewrite using Bayes rule and Markov property.\n$$ q(x_{t-1}|x_t, x_0) = \\frac{q(x_t|x_{t-1}, x_0) q(x_{t-1}|x_0)}{q(x_t|x_0)} = \\frac{q(x_t|x_{t-1}) q(x_{t-1}|x_0)}{q(x_t|x_0)} $$\nStep 2. $q(x_t|x_{t-1})$ is Gaussian.\n$$ q(x_t|x_{t-1}) = \\mathcal{N}(x_t; \\sqrt{\\alpha_t} x_{t-1}, (1-\\alpha_t)I) $$\nStep 3. $q(x_t|x_0)$ can be recursively derived through repeated applications of the reparameterization trick. And it is also Gaussian!\n$$ q(x_t|x_0) \\sim \\mathcal{N}(x_t; \\sqrt{\\bar{\\alpha}_t} x_0, (1-\\bar{\\alpha}_t)I) $$\nStep 4. Putting above all together, we can calculate the Gaussian form of $q(x_{t-1}|x_t, x_0)$.\n$$ \\begin{align} q(x_{t-1}|x_t, x_0) \u0026amp; \\propto \\mathcal{N}(x_{t-1}; \\underbrace{\\frac{\\sqrt{\\alpha_t} (1-\\bar{\\alpha}{t-1}) x_t + \\sqrt{\\bar{\\alpha}{t-1}} (1-\\alpha_t) x_0}{1-\\bar{\\alpha}t}}{\\mu_q(x_t,x_0)}, \\underbrace{\\frac{(1-\\alpha_t) (1-\\bar{\\alpha}{t-1})}{1-\\bar{\\alpha}t}I}{\\sigma_q^2(t)I}) \\ \u0026amp; = \\mathcal{N}(x{t-1}; \\mu_q(x_t, x_0), \\sigma_q^2(t)I) \\end{align} $$\nNow we have derived the form of $q(x_{t-1}|x_t, x_0)$. To calculate the KL Divergence between $q(x_{t-1}|x_t, x_0)$ and $q(x_{t-1}|x_t)$, we need to model $q(x_{t-1}|x_t)$ first. But how? In the variational diffusion model, $q(x_{t-1}|x_t)$ is modeled as:\na Gaussian the mean $\\mu_\\theta(x_t, t)$ is parameterized by $\\theta$ and is set to the form which is similar with $\\mu_q(x_t, x_0)$: $\\mu_\\theta(x_t, t) = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\alpha_t} (1-\\bar{\\alpha}{t-1}) x_t + \\sqrt{\\bar{\\alpha}{t-1}} (1-\\alpha_t) \\hat{x}_\\theta(x_t, t)}{1-\\bar{\\alpha}_t}$ the variance is same with $q(x_{t-1}|x_t, x_0)$, i.e. $\\sigma_q^2(t)I$ $$ q(x_{t-1}|x_t) = \\mathcal{N}(x_{t-1}; \\mu_\\theta(x_t, t), \\sigma_q^2(t)I) $$\nAs a result, we can derive the KL Divergence as:\n$$ \\begin{align} D_{KL}(q(x_{t-1}|x_t,x_0) || p_\\theta(x_{t-1}|x_t)) \u0026amp;= \\frac{1}{2\\sigma_q^2(t)}[||\\mu_\\theta(x_t, t) - \\mu_q(x_t, x_0)||2^2] \\ \u0026amp; = \\frac{1}{2\\sigma_q^2(t)} \\frac{\\bar{x}{t-1}(1-\\alpha_t)^2}{(1-\\bar{\\alpha}t)^2} [||\\hat{x}\\theta(x_t, t) - x_0||_2^2] \\end{align} $$\nIn practice, $\\hat{x}_\\theta(x_t, t)$ is parameterized by a neural network.\nIn summary, we have shown that optimizing a variational diffusion model boils down to learning a neural network to predict the ground truth data from a noised version of it.\nThree Equivalent Interpretations Awesome Materials For further resources and deeper insights, check out the following (non-exhaustive) list of blogs and papers:\nJianlin Su, Diffusion models (Chinese, 中文)\nCalvin Luo, Understanding Diffusion Models: A Unified Perspective\nYang Song, Generative Modeling by Estimating Gradients of the Data Distribution\nHugging Face, The Annotated Diffusion Model\nLilian Weng, What are Diffusion Models?\nGuidance: A Cheat Code for Diffusion Models\nScore based diffusions explained in just one paragraph\nA Path to the Variational Diffusion Loss\nReferences ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/notes-on-diffusion-models/","summary":"Notations $p(z|x)$: true posterior.\n$q_\\phi(z|x)$: approximate posterior with parameters $\\phi$.\n$x_0$: true data.\n$x_t, t \\in [1,T]$: latent variables.\n$q(x_{t}|x_{t-1})$: forward process.\n$p(x_t|x_{t+1})$: reverse process.\nUnderstanding Diffusion Models from the Perspective of VAE This section briefly summarizes @Luo2022 with my understanding, particularly focusing on the math logic of behind the diffusion models.
